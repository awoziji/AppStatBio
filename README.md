## Preparation

Please come to the first class with the following installed:

* Bioconductor www.bioconductor.org/install

## Summary

This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians with practical statistical and data analysis skills to perform rigorous analysis of high-throughput biological data.  The course assumes some familiarity with genomics and with R programming, but does not assume prior statistical training.  It covers the statistical concepts necessary to design experiments and analyze high-dimensional data generated by genomic technologies, including: exploratory data analysis, linear modeling, analysis of categorical variables, principal components analysis, and batch effects.

### Labs

Each day will include a hands-on lab session, that students should attempt and hand in something before the following class by committing to this Github repository. You are encouraged to work together on lab exercises, but should hand in your own individual work.

### Projects

A project will be handed out before the final class, that will involve analysing a genomics dataset.  Each student will analyse their own dataset and prepare an individual report using R Markdown for reproducible analysis and reporting.
Reports will be assessed for quality of analysis and clarity of presentation.
