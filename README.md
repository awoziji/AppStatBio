## Preparation

Please come to the first class with the following installed:

* Bioconductor www.bioconductor.org/install
* R Studio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/

## Summary

This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians with practical statistical and data analysis skills to perform rigorous analysis of high-throughput biological data.  The course assumes some familiarity with genomics and with R programming, but does not assume prior statistical training.  It covers the statistical concepts necessary to design experiments and analyze high-dimensional data generated by genomic technologies, including: exploratory data analysis, linear modeling, analysis of categorical variables, principal components analysis, and batch effects.
